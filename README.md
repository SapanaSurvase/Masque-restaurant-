# Masque-restaurant-
#Audit-Course
This is a part of an Audit Course named “Industry Ready Web Developer” in which I have used Basic HTML and CSS to create a raw layout of the website 
So, I decide to create a copy of original website of masque restaurant and further improvisations are needed to make it more dynamic and ready to use which will be done as we approach further levels
